The geo-visualization of broadband networks in India 

# Mobile Network Analysis and Geo-Visualization Project

In the rapidly evolving landscape of mobile broadband networks, ensuring widespread and reliable connectivity is imperative. This project pioneers a dynamic paradigm for mobile network analysis by introducing a novel approach to adjust cell tower ranges dynamically, leveraging machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, K-Means Clustering, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks. The model facilitates precise geo-visualizations that highlight network coverage and identify "no network zones" in real time.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Range Adjustment:** Real-time adjustment of cell tower ranges based on network performance metrics, transcending traditional static models.
  
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Incorporating Random Forest, K-Means Clustering, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks for adaptive network optimization.

- **Geo-Visualizations:** Detailed visualizations providing insights into network coverage, allowing for identifying areas lacking connectivity.

- **Identification of "No Network Zones":** Highlighting and visualizing areas with suboptimal connectivity, providing valuable insights for both end-users and service providers.

- **User-Centric Network Optimization:** Focusing on user experience to tailor network adjustments based on user preferences and expectations.

## Scope

The project's scope encompasses network optimization, real-time adaptability, geo-visualization techniques, user-centric approaches, insights for service providers, applicability across network operators, scalability, and considerations for future advancements.

## Methodology
